Objective 1: Patient Detection on the Bed
Develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting the presence of comatose patients on their beds using video feeds. This objective involves training the model to identify and localize patients within the surveillance footage, ensuring robust and reliable patient detection.


Objective 2: Authorization of Moving Personnel
Implement a system that can distinguish between authorized and unauthorized personnel moving around comatose patients. This objective involves training the surveillance system to recognize and classify healthcare staff, visitors, or other individuals based on predefined authorization criteria, contributing to enhanced security measures.

Objective 3: Avoidance of Unnecessary Detections
Optimize the surveillance system to minimize unnecessary detections of individuals around comatose patients during unexpected times or non-security-critical situations. This objective aims to refine the model's sensitivity and specificity to prevent false alarms, ensuring the system's efficiency and reducing unnecessary disruptions.
